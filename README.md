# Club App Developed in Kotlin
App that displays an up-to-date ranking of top European soccer teams. The ranking is recalculated daily based on market values. A backend that has already been implemented handles all evaluations and prepares the data specifically for the app. It returns an unsorted list of clubs. Subsequent change by the customer: The API returns another field that indicates how many titles the respective club has already won at European level (Champions Cup, Champions League, Europa League)
